<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>
  I am a software engineer with over 8 years of hands-on programming experience,
  including 4.5+ years in the industry within a dynamic product-based company.
  Passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, I use
  code as a tool to create software that significantly improves people’s lives.
  Beyond my professional expertise in navigating the complete software
  development lifecycle, I extend my passion for coding to address challenges
  encountered in my daily life.
</p>
<p>
  What sets me apart is not only my technical proficiency but also my innovative
  approach. I bring a unique blend of adaptability and creativity to every
  project, whether collaborating seamlessly in a team or working independently
  with self-motivation. Committed to continuous growth and staying abreast of
  the latest industry trends, I ensure that my contributions align with
  cutting-edge practices in software engineering while utilizing code to address
  real-world challenges beyond the professional realm.
</p>
<p>
  I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from the
  National Institute of Technology Calicut, India in 2017. From 2017 till the
  end of 2021, I worked as a software engineer at Target India’s Bangalore
  office, working on various projects in the Supply Chain and Transportation
  domain. I left Target to pursue my Master’s in Software Systems Engineering at
  RWTH Aachen University starting in Winter 2021. During my Master’s, I kept
  myself engaged by working as a student assistant, first at the University
  itself and later at Fraunhofer FIT. I have since completed my Master’s and am
  currently looking for opportunities in the software engineering domain.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and building personal
  projects. My other hobbies include watching Arsenal and Formula 1, playing
  badminton and travelling with my friends.
